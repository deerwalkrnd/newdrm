To help us walk on the path of knowing Vipassana meditation more clearly we have Avina Nakarmi of Batch 2020 with us, who had taken this 10 day Vipassana meditation in December 2019.\r\n\r\nFor starters who don\'t have knowledge of meditation or to be precise, Vipassana meditation, how would you like to introduce it to them and how is it different from other forms of meditation?\r\n\r\nVipassana is a type of meditation in which Buddha himself rediscovered it. To be precise, itâ€™s actually observing yourself, avoiding the external materialistic kind of stuffs and just looking into ourselves, our emotions, and our reality.\r\n\r\nWith what Iâ€™m familiar with, other meditation usually involves a lot of chantings and you can even see at Pashupati where people play loud Bhajans and dance and meditate there. Instead of concentrating within yourself, youâ€™re concentrating on external factors but in vipassana, you look into yourself, and the things youâ€™ve experienced. While meditating, you learn more about yourself and you feel new sensation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy did you take Vipassana meditation course?\r\n\r\nYou know the schedule of Deerwalk, classes start from early morning and ends in the late evening, internships and everything plus we had additional projects during 5th-6th semester. So it was kind of hectic to keep up, there was just so much going on. After all my deadlines, I was free at that moment and I thought it would be helpful if I went to Vipassana meditation, in order to reduce the amount of stress that had built up.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow did you come to know about Vipassana meditation? Were you encouraged or influenced by someone into taking it?\r\n\r\nActually, during my teenage time, my cousins used to go for Vipassana meditation but at that time, I couldn\'t go. It had quite slipped my mind after that but recently our Image Processing sir, Sarbin Sayami had taken this course and he shared his experience with us which motivated me into taking it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThey say that taking Vipassana meditation is not an easy task as it requires a lot of determination, how well did you cope up with it?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, the first few days were really hard. The routine included waking up at 4-4:30 A.M then heading out for straight 2 hours of meditation. The breakfast would be casual boiled healthy foods but even the simple food would taste extremely good and awaited after the intense 2 hours meditation. The major difficulty I faced was to sit erect without any support continuously for 3-4 hours while meditating as I was used to sitting on chairs with support. We were only allowed to go out 2-3 times. There was the system of early sleep so we had to go to bed at sharp 9 P.M, the first few days I couldn\'t fall asleep at all because it wasnâ€™t my usual routine. But after 4-5 days, I got used to it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVipassana meditation is a universal remedy for universal ill, what is your say in this? Can you relate it with your experience?\r\n\r\nI canâ€™t relate it with myself because I havenâ€™t been through the stage where I felt very low in my life but I\'ve heard stories of people who went through severe depression and physical illness like diabetes and after taking vipassana course they felt relief to some extent and some of them were even cured wholly. \r\n\r\nWhile I was researching about Vipassana meditation, somewhere I found that after vipassana course few individuals fell into depression because vipassana course walks you through the path of isolation in order to reflect within yourself and as a result, it resurfaces the trauma an individual had felt before in his/her lifetime. What is your view on this?\r\n\r\nWhen we are isolated itâ€™s normal for many thoughts to resurface, which tends people to get sad and depressed but thatâ€™s why the teachers are there, they are so friendly and they will make you feel comfortable so you can express yourself to them. The trauma, you relieve it for a while and then you start to accept it, whatever happened, it happened in the past and itâ€™s gone now. Youâ€™ll realize that everything is just a phase. And once you get used to that, every sadness or any extreme feeling like excitement, fear will be just a phase, a phase that will go away so you donâ€™t tend to cling on stuff anymore.\r\n \r\nHow can we join this course?\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re interested, you can fill out the form at City office, Jamal. Itâ€™s situated near the Honda showroom. There they give you a pamphlet and ask you to go through it before filling the form. You must have strong determination and will power for it as youâ€™ll be going for 10 days where you canâ€™t use your phone or any other devices, the communication will be limited with the teachers only. Before leaving for the meditation there will be a small orientation session where you have one to one conversation with the Guruba and Guruaama; what they tend to do is they ask you whether youâ€™re fully determined to join this or not, if not then you shouldn\'t join as it is a hard course. \r\n\r\nWhat changes have you felt after practicing Vipassana meditation?\r\n\r\nYou wonâ€™t feel the changes instantly, but eventually youâ€™ll feel more relaxed. The fear, jitters, and nervousness I used to feel while interacting with people, I\'ve learned to control it now. I feel calmer after having taken Vipassana meditation.\r\n \r\nWould you recommend Vipassana meditation to others?\r\n\r\nYes, I totally recommend it to others. But I also recommend people to go with full determination so that you wonâ€™t have to leave it in the middle. You will witness the positive changes in your life after practicing vipassana meditation. The journey is not easy but the fruit of this meditation is so worth it   ','2020-02-17 10:35:55','INTERVIEW: EXPERIENCE OF VIPASSANA MEDITATION','9150551580129860.jpg'),(27,1,'DWIT, My Story!\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 2015\r\n\r\nI got an email from Bijaya Shrestha Sir entitled â€œWelcome To SEM I - Batch 2019â€ and the class would begin from 30th of November. I was so fascinated, nervous, excited about the new journey I was about to be part of. I was so impressed by DWIT from my open-house session and being able to be part of this community was super exciting. \r\n\r\nNovember 30, 2015\r\n\r\nI reached the college gate where I saw many new faces standing in line with me. The line was oriented by our senior who took us to our class. As the line moved on, the first dayâ€™s journey from gate to classroom number 203 felt amazing. I was enjoying every sight I could see.\r\n\r\nNovember 22, 2019\r\n\r\n9:50 AM. We were wished all the best for our boards by our cloud computing teacher, Shambhu Khanal. That meant we had concluded the class and it marked the completion of lectures at Deerwalk. The class had never been so loud as it was then when everyone yelled â€œThank You Sirâ€ so loud. We were happy because every one of us had passed our undergraduate hurdle. Deep down the happiness, we also had a thick layer of sadness of having to leave the college. Emotions were flowing all over my nerves that day. From carrying my bag to checking out the college gate, I was occupied by emotions and some droplets of heavy tears that flashed back to my four years at Deerwalk.\r\n\r\nYou guys might wonder why was the tear so heavy? So, let\'s roll on to the flashback!\r\n\r\nI still remember the first calculus class of semester one lectured by Surendra Pathak Sir. We were told to introduce ourselves. I was glad to meet all the unknown people I was surrounded with who are now an integral part of my life. First few weeks were so interesting as we were the newest batch and it\'s always the newest batch that gets attention from everyone. Coming to college at 8:50 AM and leaving the college at 7:00 PM in the evening, yes, that was life for us which we thoroughly enjoyed. We never felt like leaving college early. What kept me to the college that late was the bond among the seniors I had, the unlimited chat with classmates about literally everything, the college environment that blossomed throughout the day and many more.\r\nWith all the enjoyment, we also started adapting ourselves to the pressure. Pressure in Deerwalk includes academic, assignment, ECA responsibilities, deadlines (the most). Now I realize, with all that pressure I faced, I am more of a matured person now. Apart from these, I enjoyed my club journey in DWIT as well which is a rollercoaster ride. I was brought up as an outspoken person, be it on stage or in social circle. With that ability of mine, I joined DeerExpress Club as my first club. Things were not so smooth for me, so I had to leave the club in the middle because of some misunderstanding. From leaving the DeerExpress Club in 2016 to being president of the club in 2018, I realized things that start bad always have a perfect ending.\r\n\r\nIn my days, I always enjoyed organizing events like deerfest, deer utsav. I must say events like these in Deerwalk are cherry in cake; you get a chance to interact with seniors and juniors and they will be a part of your journey. I just don\'t have memories with 47 of my friends, I have memories with everyone who thought being in touch with me was not a bad choice.\r\n\r\nAs I write long, I also want to say something about my batch, Class of 2019. Guys, we have come all this way. It is inevitable that we may not always have this kind of togetherness in the future. But remembering all the memories we had and at least smiling to that instant of flashback will be enough. We started this journey as individuals, we end this journey as being the most unified and entertaining batch of Deerwalk. I will remember being called â€œCanceeeerrrrâ€, I will remember being called â€œGuffadi/Jhapaliâ€, I will remember the fights we had and each one of us, I will remember sleeping at class and being punched by Prakash Sir, I will remember all my seniors who treated me more like a family, I will remember each millisecond of my time at DWIT.\r\nWhen I saw my seniors graduating in every deer utsav, I always thought of graduating as early as possible. Now I only have some months for my graduation, I want the time not to pass any sooner. I don\'t want my green card to be a red one. But, I also remember the fact that nothing lasts forever and show must always go on!\r\n\r\nLastly, thank you all for making it a wonderful journey. Each one you have a special place in my heart.\r\n\r\nIris R Pokharel\r\nBatch of 2019','2020-02-17 10:37:34','MY 4 YEARS AT DWIT','9151541580736195.jpg'),(28,1,'For the first time in the history of DWIT, The Artistas Club is organizing PROM NIGHT 2020.

As our club promotes various kinds of art forms, this event is being organized to provide a platform for young and aspiring event managers to showcase and improve their management skills along with a goal to provide a break from a monotonous day-to-day routine.\r\n\r\nA lot of people are still confused about PROM Night. What can the attendees expect from the night can you please elaborate in detail ? Why should anyone not miss The Prom 2020 ?\r\n\r\nThrough this event what we want to do is break the stereotype. Prom season is upon us and many girls and guys are building up the courage to ask out their crush! Prom night isn\'t just about dancing! There will be great food, a photo booth, maybe even a dessert table, cash and gift vouchers giveaways. So don\'t worry about having two left feet. Enjoy the atmosphere and focus on having a great night. You can\'t deny that getting dressed up for a night out is so much fun. Sure, the preparation can be a hassle, like finding the perfect dress and deciding on the perfect hairstyle, but when you\'re all done and you finally take a look in the mirror, you\'ll be pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nPlus, one of the best parts of prom is showing off how good you look! And who doesn\'t love a party? No one cares if you can\'t dance or if you come without a date. You are there to have one of the best nights ever. Life is short and you don\'t want to regret not going to prom. So let loose and have fun! So I request everyone to join us, enjoy the time with your friends, and make the night a memory that will last forever cause when you look back, you just donâ€™t want to see yourself as a student who only attended the college lectures.\r\n\r\nIs the event only for DWIT students?\r\n\r\nNo, this event is not only for the students.

This is more like a socializing event, so everyone doesnâ€™t need to come in pairs.\r\n\r\nWhat are the  exciting events planned for the night ?\r\n\r\nThe event includes snacks, soft drinks, batch-wise candle light dinner, ball dance, DJ, performances by the Students, exciting games like 5 quick questions about your partner/friend and paper dance followed by Prom King and Queen announcement. At last the program is scheduled to conclude with a cake cutting ceremony  by the batch of 2019 as a gesture of love to our seniors.\r\n\r\nAt what time is the event starting and how long is the event going to be ? And are the tickets for the Prom still available?\r\n\r\nThe event is scheduled to begin from 2 PM onwards and will end at around  7 PM. Yes, the tickets are still available with the club members. So, if anyone wants to be a part of the romantic evening, you can contact The Artistas Club without hesitation.\r\n\r\nWas it hard for the club to handle the responsibilities of the Prom all by themselves?\r\n\r\nFor the first time in college history, The Artistas club is organizing â€œThe Prom 2020â€ so it is definitely going to need a strenuous effort. But since our club members are so conscientious, itâ€™s not much of a pressure.\r\n\r\nAre other DWIT clubs collaborating with the Artistas to make the event successful? \r\n\r\nYes, the Music Club has collaborated with The Artistas to sooth the evening with melodic performances. The Media Club is helping with the photo coverage and The Documentary Club has taken the responsibility for the visual filming.\r\n\r\nLastly do you have any message for the attendees ?\r\n\r\nThis is the right time to know each other more and build good bonding among the circles. Hence, keeping that in mind, this event invites everyone from the high school, college, alumni and also the company employees. I believe, socializing and attending events will help us enrich our life. We are so stuck in the tedious routine, that every once in awhile we need to shake it up a bit. Doing something new and having some new adventures, acquaintances, I bet thatâ€™s what â€œThe Prom 2020â€ is all about. So, I encourage everyone to not miss this jovial event.','2020-02-17 10:38:48','PROM NIGHT 2020: WHAT TO EXPECT?','9152291581337297.jpg'),(29,1,'Rudra Pandey is the chairman executive of DeerWalk Inc.\r\nRudra Pandey comes from a lower-middle-class family in Kanakot. He had a very bright mind since his childhood. Brought up by his grandfatherâ€™s influences and teachings, Rudra Pandey is a very positive man who never gives up in his dreams.\r\nHe was once totally discouraged when he couldnâ€™t read his physics book in his first month of Isc years in Trichandra College, Kathmandu. That demotivation led Pandey to join ANNSU (the student group affiliated to the communist party of Nepal, Marxist and Leninist (ML)). He spent months on political work as a student without focusing on his studies.  His elder brother helped him escape his addiction towards politics and speeches in political parties and that was when Pandey started working hard in his studies. He didnâ€™t let the light inside him go off. As a result, Rudra Pandey was the college topper in the year 1984.\r\nDue to his brilliant result, Rudra Pandey was able to secure a scholarship to study in one of the top universities in Asia, Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Pakistan, where he completed his Undergraduate in Electrical Engineering. Before his Undergraduate, he worked for many organizations including Nepal Telecom and Royal National Academy of Science and Technology. He claims himself as an â€˜opportunistâ€™ who grabbed the better jobs as soon as he was offered.\r\nHis first step in entrepreneurship was when he started a company called Comptronix with one of his friends during his ISc, but it wasnâ€™t a great success. Later, he started a business (GECS) as a dealer of computer hardware from HongKong and Taiwan along with his friend. Rudra Pandey got his Ph.D. on Economics from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. He also worked in parking lots, as a security guard and due to his nature of taking risks he got many chances and opportunities. Ultimately, he was able to work in Bank of America.\r\nRudra Pandey along with Chris Kryder built a company D2Hawkeye Services in the year 2001 where he got help from his company GECS in Nepal. Finally, in 2010, he established Deerwalk Services. He is now a very successful person who built an empire all by himself starting from a ground level. He is a true inspiration to all of us.\r\nMy encounter with Rudra Pandey has always been very pleasant. He never hesitates to make a small casual conversation about anything like college or our classes, etc. He is a truly simple and humble man. I sincerely think of him as an absolute down to earth person.','2020-03-03 02:05:46','THINGS YOU PROBABLY DIDNâ€™T KNOW ABOUT RUDRA PANDEY','223647r.jpg'),(30,1,'Nepal has provided an exotic and mystical backdrop to numerous international movie sets. Not only Bollywood and Hollywood movies have been shot in Nepal several other movies have also portrayed the serenity of Nepal. Along with the cinematic beauty of Nepal, the culture, tradition and religious aspects are also exquisitely represented by the films. Movies directly or indirectly charge an impression in our mind and heart. The same way whenever Nepal is exhibited in various international movies, it leaves some impact on the audience on how Nepal actually is and it draws them towards Nepal. Some of the films which were shot in Nepal are mentioned below:\r\n\r\nDoctor Strange\r\nDoctor Strange, a marvel comic based superhero sci-fi movie had a few scenes of Nepal. It was shot in Pashupatinath, Swayambhunath, Thamel, Newroad, Patan Durbar Square. Although various monuments of Nepal were under reconstruction due to the massive earthquake of 2072 B.S still the production unit continued shooting to bring the world\'s attention towards the country.\r\n\r\nBaraka\r\nBaraka presents footage of people, places and things from around the world. The movie was shot in 24 countries on six continents over a 14-month period.â€ The movie covered the Himalayas and various World Heritage Sites of Kathmandu. \r\n\r\nHare Rama Hare Krishna\r\nHare Rama Hare Krishna is said to be the first Bollywood film to be shot in Nepal. Dev Anand, the director came up with the idea for this movie when he was in Kathmandu. This movie resulted in a tremendous flow of Indian tourists into Nepal.\r\n\r\nBeyond the edge\r\nBeyond the edge is a movie portraying the historical ascent of Mount Everest by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. This movie beautifully projected the adventurous nature of Mount Everest, making the world know about it more vividly.\r\n\r\nSeven Years in Tibet\r\nA biographical war drama film, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and screen played by heartthrob Brad Pitt, Seven Years in Tibet had some of its scenes shot in Nepal which projected Nepal as a peaceful tourist destination.\r\n\r\nGharwali Baharwali \r\nOne of the most-watched comedy-dramas released in 1998, the movie Gharwali Baharwali comprises few scenes of Nepal. The movie presents how loyal and loving a Nepali woman is to her husband and is willing to take any risk in order to save him.\r\n\r\nThe mesmerizing Himalayas, Hills, Culture, and the Serenity of Lord Buddha are often found to be represented in the movies. Along with the above-mentioned films, many more films are there which show the living lifestyle, monuments and bewitching beauty of Nepal.','2020-03-03 02:07:09','NEPAL PORTRAYED THROUGH FOREIGN MOVIES','223730n.jpg'),(31,1,'The Deerwalk Developers Community is a platform at Deerwalk Institute of Technology for students having the same interest to team up together and learn from each other. The community aims to make a team of enthusiastic learners and help them run together. Every group will have a leader and a six month tenure which will have two phases, Learning and Project Phase. In the Learning Phase, team members will study the technology and follow the same learning path to help each other. Once the team members are comfortable with this,  they will move to the project phase. In the latter phase, team members will work together to build a real world project.\r\n\r\nCommunity Goal\r\n\r\nThe main objective to start this community was to establish a learning environment in the college. According to the president and the founder of the community, Aaakash Bhandari, his leadership will focus on creating  an almost identical environment to other IT colleges abroad where students form groups and work together on the technology they want to learn. He believes that group learning will make the learning process much easier and efficient.    In addition, the community also plans to conduct different inter school events.Hour of Code outside the college and extend the community throughout the different IT colleges based in Nepal.\r\n\r\nCurrent Members\r\n\r\nAt present, Aakash Bhandari holds the position of  president, Shubham Joshi has been appointed as the vice president and Aiswarya Sapkota is the treasurer of the committee. The community has 8 executive members : Raman Lamichhane, Sujan Adhikari, Sagar Giri, Deena Sitikhu, Simran Prajuli, Aabiskar Pandey, Umang Pathak and Ramesh Tamag.\r\n\r\nActive Groups \r\n\r\nThe newly formed community has been bestowed with  great responses from the students. Lots of students have  shown interest in joining the community. Currently, there are 5 active groups: Game Development on Unity with 14 members, Web Development with 23 members, Ethical Hacking with 15 members, Software Quality Assurance with 3 members and IOT with 7 members.\r\n\r\nWhy Community when there are already different Clubs in the college ?\r\n\r\nThere might arise a question amongst DWIT students on why a separate community is needed when we already have clubs to conduct different workshops? The answer to this is quite simple; the community actually has a different set of goals as compared to the clubs. While a Club is focused on conducting workshops which lasts for just a few days, the community students will have a learning time for  the entire 6 months This means, the students will get a fair amount of time to learn and let alone learning, they will also be working on a projects as a team which will surely add up to their CV.','2020-03-03 02:08:36','AN INTRODUCTION TO DEERWALK DEVELOPERS COMMUNITY','223817s.png');
